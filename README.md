# FAQ

# Fibucks FAQ

Welcome to the Fibucks FAQ section! Below you'll find answers to some of the most common questions regarding installation issues, setup requirements, and feature usage.

## Installation Issues

### 1. What should I do if I encounter dependency issues during installation?
If you experience dependency conflicts, ensure that you're using compatible versions of each package. You can check for the latest stable versions by reviewing the official documentation for each package. Use commands like `npm outdated` to identify discrepancies and try updating conflicting dependencies using `npm install <package@latest>`.

### 2. How do I resolve errors when installing `bcrypt`?
`bcrypt` can sometimes have native build issues. Make sure you have the required build tools installed for your operating system. On Windows, you may need to install windows-build-tools. For macOS, ensure you have Xcode Command Line Tools installed. If issues persist, consider using `bcryptjs` as a pure JavaScript alternative.

### 3. I'm getting "module not found" errors after installation, what should I do?
Ensure you have run `npm install` or `yarn install` successfully in the project root. The folder structure shown in the file structure section confirms that files should reside within `src/`. Also, verify that the imports in your components and modules reference the correct paths.

## Setup Requirements

### 4. What are the minimum system requirements to run Fibucks?
Fibucks requires Node.js version 14.x or higher to run the application effectively. Additionally, you'll need a database setup like MongoDB as `mongoose` is used for database interactions. Ensure that you have a compatible environment that satisfies these requirements.

### 5. How should I configure environment variables for Nodemailer?
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Add your email service configuration with variables like `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, and others as necessary. The `src/lib/mailer.ts` file should be set up to read from these environment variables.

### 6. Do I need a specific database setup?
Yes, Fibucks utilizes MongoDB for data storage. Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and connected by updating the connection URI in `src/dbConfig/dbConfig.ts`.

## Feature Usage

### 7. How do I utilize the transaction feature?
You can interact with transactions via the various APIs. For instance, to add a transaction, send a POST request to the `/api/users/transactions` endpoint. The corresponding logic is managed in `src/app/api/users/transactions/route.ts`. You can view and manage transactions in the `src/app/transactions/page.tsx`.

### 8. What components do I use to display transaction data?
You will primarily use the `TransactionList.tsx` and `TransactionChart.tsx` within `src/components/global/` to render transaction data visually. The `TransactionList` component displays a list of transactions, while `TransactionChart` provides a graphical representation using Chart.js.

### 9. How does the form handling work in Fibucks?
Form handling is primarily facilitated by `react-hook-form` in `src/components/ui/form.tsx` and `src/components/global/FormFields.tsx`. Use the components from these files to set up your forms and manage validations through `@hookform/resolvers` and `zod`.

### 10. How do I implement themes in my app?
The theming is managed through `next-themes`
