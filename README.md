# Technologies and Libraries

Analyzing the dependencies for the project "Fibucks," we can identify several key libraries that significantly contribute to the project's overall functionality and performance. Here is a breakdown of some of the important libraries and their roles:

### Key Libraries and Their Contributions

1. **@hookform/resolvers and react-hook-form**:
   - **Functionality**: These libraries are critical for managing forms in a React application. `react-hook-form` streamlines the process of building forms with easy validation and state management. `@hookform/resolvers` integrates various validation libraries (like Zod) into `react-hook-form`, allowing for seamless form validation.
   - **Importance**: Since a finance-related application like Fibucks likely requires user input for transactions and account management, these libraries facilitate efficient, user-friendly forms.

2. **axios**:
   - **Functionality**: Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that enables the application to make requests to external APIs or backend services.
   - **Importance**: For a project that might involve fetching user data, transaction history, or interacting with third-party financial services, Axios is essential for handling asynchronous requests reliably.

3. **mongoose**:
   - **Functionality**: Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward way to model application data.
   - **Importance**: As a potential backend framework, it simplifies database operations for storing user information, transaction records, and more. This is crucial for any data-driven application.

4. **zod**:
   - **Functionality**: Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library, allowing developers to define and validate data structures.
   - **Importance**: In a finance application, data integrity is critical. Zod helps validate the shape of incoming data, ensuring it adheres to expected formats, which is especially important for user input fields.

5. **chart.js and react-chartjs-2**:
   - **Functionality**: These libraries enable the creation of interactive and visually appealing charts. `react-chartjs-2` is a React wrapper for Chart.js, making it easy to integrate charts into React applications.
   - **Importance**: For Fibucks, displaying financial data visually (like spending trends or account balances) is vital. User engagement and understanding can be significantly enhanced through visual representations of data.

6. **@radix-ui/react-* libraries** (dropdown-menu, select, progress, toast, tabs, etc.):
   - **Functionality**: Radix UI components provide low-level, unstyled, and accessible building blocks for creating UI components in React applications.
   - **Importance**: These libraries help to build a consistent, user-friendly, and accessible interface. Features like dropdown menus and toasts for notifications can enhance user experience and interaction within the application.

7. **next and next-themes**:
   - **Functionality**: Next.js is a React framework for building web applications with server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing. The `next-themes` package allows for easy theme switching.
   - **Importance**: Next.js powers the application’s routing and rendering, while `next-themes` provides aesthetic flexibility for users, potentially enhancing user retention through customizable UI experiences.

8. **bcrypt**:
   - **Functionality**: Bcrypt is used for hashing passwords.
   - **Importance**: Security is paramount in
