#### 4. Mailer Utility (`mailer.ts`)
- **Imports**: Uses Mongoose for database interaction, Nodemailer for sending emails, and UUID for token generation.
- **Functionality**: Provides a `sendMail` function to facilitate sending verification and password reset emails. It updates user tokens in the database and sends customized email content based on the email type.
- **Error Handling**: Implements error handling for logging and notifying failures in email sending.

#### 5. Utility Functions (`utils.ts`)
- **Functionality**: Defines a utility function `cn()` to merge Tailwind CSS classes using the `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` libraries, allowing for conditional class management in components.

### Overall Themes:
- The files collectively showcase a modular and component-driven approach in React, utilizing reusable UI components and utility functions. They employ a consistent styling strategy and are geared towards enhancing user interactions while ensuring maintainability and operational efficiency in sending emails and managing UI states.

### ./src/app/signup/page.tsx
Here's a summary of each file:

### 1. **./src/app/signup/page.tsx**
This file defines a React component `SignUpPage` for a user registration form. The component uses local state to manage loading status and integrates with a toast notification system for user feedback. On form submission, it captures user inputs (username, email, and password) and sends them via an axios POST request to the server. Success and error messages are displayed using the `toast` function. The UI consists of input fields for the user to enter their credentials, along with a navigation link to the login page.

### 2. **./src/app/financeinputs/page.tsx**
The `FinanceInputPage` component allows users to input their financial information. It utilizes the `react-hook-form` library for form management, with a Zod schema for validation. The page features a tabbed interface for different financial categories (credit cards, depository accounts, investments, loans, real estate, and others). It fetches existing financial data on load and allows users to save new data through an axios POST request. A toast notification provides feedback after form submission. Editing states are tracked to avoid unsaved data loss when switching tabs.

### 3. **./src/app/login/page.tsx**
This component, `LoginPage`, is designed for user authentication. It checks for existing user authentication via an axios GET request, redirecting authenticated users to a dashboard. Upon form submission, it collects user credentials and attempts to log in using a POST request. Feedback is provided via toast notifications indicating success or failure. The UI consists of input fields for email and password, along with a link to navigate to the signup page.

### 4. **./src/dbConfig/dbConfig.ts**
This module exports a `connect` function that establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. It handles connection events, logging success or errors to the console and terminating the process on connection failure.

### 5. **./src/hooks/use-toast.ts**
The `useToast` hook implements a custom toast notification system. It manages toast notifications through a reducer pattern, allowing toasts to be added, updated, dismissed, or removed. A maximum of one toast can be displayed at a time, and each toast has a delay before removal. The `toast` function is provided for use within components to trigger notifications, and the hook returns the current state of toasts along with functions for interacting with them.

Each file efficiently encapsulates functionality related to user authentication, finance management, database connection, and notification handling in a modular way, allowing for organized code architecture.
