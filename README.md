## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)
- A MongoDB instance (either locally or using Atlas)

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the repository from GitHub (or your source of choice).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fibucks.git
   cd fibucks
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the necessary environment variables. An example template might look like this:

   ```plaintext
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/fibucks
   NODE_ENV=development
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
   ```

   Make sure to replace the values accordingly.

## Environment Setup

1. **MongoDB Configuration:**
   If you are using a local MongoDB instance, ensure it is running. If you are using MongoDB Atlas, make sure your connection string is correct in the `.env` file.

2. **Tailwind CSS:**
   If you need to build Tailwind CSS styles, ensure you have it installed and configured properly. The project should include a `tailwind.config.js` if you have custom styles.

## Running the Project

You can now run the project with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This should start the Next.js app in development mode. By default, it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### File Structure Overview

The key folders and files in the project are organized as follows:

- **`src/models/`**: This directory contains your database schemas and models, such as `financeSchema.ts` and `userModel.js`.
- **`src/components/`**: This contains React components such as global components (`TransactionList.tsx`, `FormFields.tsx`) and UI components (`button.tsx`, `input.tsx`).
- **`src/app/`**: This includes the routing structure, each folder representing a page (e.g., `page.tsx`, `dashboard/page.tsx`).
- **`src/lib/`**: Contains utility functions and libraries, like `mailer.ts` for handling email functionalities.
- **`src/dbConfig/`**: Configuration files for connecting to the database.

### Router Type

Fibucks uses the **App Router** provided by Next.js, which allows for file-based routing. Each page in the `src/app/` directory corresponds to a route based on its file structure.

### Running Tests

If you want to run tests (using Chai), you can do so with:

```bash
npm test
```

## Additional Commands

- **Build the Project**: 
   ```bash
   npm run build

# Scripts and Commands

# Scripts and Commands for Fibucks Project

This section outlines the various scripts available for the Fibucks project, detailing their usage and significance in the development and maintenance of the application. Each command serves a distinct purpose, contributing to different stages of the development lifecycle.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. Development Command: **dev**
- **Command**: `next dev`
- **Usage**: Run this command during the development phase to start the Next.js development server.
- **Importance**: The `dev` command initializes the application in development mode, enabling features like hot module replacement. This means any changes made to the code are automatically reflected in the browser without the need for a page refresh. It also provides detailed error messages and debugging tools, making it essential for efficient development and troubleshooting.

### 2. Build Command: **build**
- **Command**: `next build`
- **Usage**: Execute this command to compile the application for production deployment.
- **Importance**: The `build` command optimizes the application by generating the necessary static files and server-rendered pages, enhancing performance and reducing load times. Additionally, it performs code minification and bundling, ensuring that the application runs efficiently in a production environment. This step is crucial before deploying updates or launching the application for public use.

### 3. Start Command: **start**
- **Command**: `next start`
- **Usage**: Use this command to start the Next.js production server after a successful build.
- **Importance**: The `start` command runs the optimized version of your application that was created during the build process. This server handles incoming requests and delivers the pre-rendered content to users. This is the command that should be used in a live environment to serve the application and is critical for ensuring the best performance and user experience.

### 4. Testing Command: **test**
- **Command**: `mocha 'test/*.js'`
- **Usage**: Run this command to execute the unit tests defined in the test directory.
- **Importance**: The `test` command leverages Mocha, a popular JavaScript testing framework, to run automated tests on the Fibucks application. Regularly executing tests helps ensure that new changes do not introduce bugs or regressions. It is vital for maintaining code quality and reliability, allowing developers to catch issues early in the development process.

## Summary

These scripts form the backbone of the Fibucks development workflow, allowing developers to effectively build, run, and test the application. By leveraging these commands, the team can ensure a smooth development process, optimize production performance, and maintain high-quality standards throughout the project lifecycle.

# FAQ

### Fibucks FAQ

#### Installation Issues

**Q1: What should I do if I encounter dependency installation errors?**  
A: If you encounter errors during installation, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can check your versions with `node -v` and `npm -v`. Ensure your package manager is up to date using `npm install -g npm`. If the issues persist, try deleting your `node_modules` folder and your `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.

**Q2: Why am I getting errors related to specific packages like Axois or bcrypt?**  
A: Dependency conflicts can arise if you have other packages that require different versions. Make sure all your dependencies are compatible with each other. Utilize `npm ls <package-name>` to see if there are multiple versions of a package and resolve conflicts accordingly.

**Q3: The installation is taking a long time; what can I do?**  
A: If the installation process is unusually slow, it might be due to network issues or your machineâ€™s performance. Check your internet connection and consider using a package manager like Yarn that can speed up installations through caching.

#### Setup Requirements

**Q4: What are the minimum system requirements to run Fibucks?**  
A: Fibucks requires Node.js 14.x or later and npm version 6.x or later. Make sure your machine has sufficient RAM (at least 4GB recommended) for optimal performance, especially when running a development server.

**Q5: Do I need to set up a database?**  
A: Yes, Fibucks uses MongoDB for data management. Ensure that MongoDB is installed and running on your system. Modify the `src/dbConfig/dbConfig.ts` file to point to your database instance.

#### Feature Usage

**Q6: How do I use the global components like TransactionList or Loader?**  
A: You can import the components from their respective paths within the `src/components/global/` directory. For example, to use the TransactionList component, you would include it in your desired page or component like so:
```javascript
import TransactionList from '../components/global/TransactionList';

// In the render method:
<TransactionList />
```

**Q7: How can I customize the form inputs using FormFields?**  
A: You can directly use the `FormFields` component located in `src/components/global/FormFields.tsx`. Passing props to it will allow you to dictate the fields needed for each form. Make sure to also utilize `react-hook-form` for form management and validation.

**Q8: How can I implement user authentication using the provided routes?**  
A: Fibucks provides several API routes in the `src/app/api/users/` directory for user authentication (login, signup, logout). You can make HTTP requests via Axios to these endpoints. For example:
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const loginUser = async (credentials) => {
    try {
        const response = await axios.post('/api/users/login', credentials);
        console.log(response.data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error logging in", error);
    }
};
```

**Q9: What is the best way to keep track of finance inputs in the app?**  
A: Utilize the `src/app/transactions/page.tsx` page and integrate it with components like `TransactionList` to display
